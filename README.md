### Technical Details

#### Architecture
The app will make use of the BLoC pattern to handle data flow and the Provider package for state management and dependency injection.

The Business Logic Component (BLoC) pattern is a pattern created by Google and announced at Google I/O â€™18. The BLoC pattern uses Reactive Programming to handle the flow of data within an app.

A BLoC stands as a middleman between a source of data in your app (e.g an API response) and widgets that need the data. It receives streams of events/data from the source, handles any required business logic and publishes streams of data changes to widgets that are interested in them.
